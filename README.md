# voiceClassifier

As part of my Machine Learning final course project, we applied three different binary classification methods, namely logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, and Naive Bayes, to determine which method is most accurate in classifying male and female voices.

This repository contains the explanatory diagrams and processing algorithms for a binary classification project.
